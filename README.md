# 3-Body-Problem-Simulation:
A very simple simulation of three gravitationally interacting bodies without collision implemented in python. Useful as a reference for someone interested in the physics of simulation. 
# Lorentz force on a system of charges
A simple simulation for time evoultion of charged particles under external or mutual (or both) E,B fields implemented in Fortran 90/95.
